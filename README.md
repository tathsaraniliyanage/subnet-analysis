# Subnet Analysis Automation

#### This project provides a web-based tool for subnet analysis and IP address conversion. It allows you to analyze IP addresses and subnet masks, providing valuable information about the network structure. Additionally, it features an IP Converter to help you convert IP addresses between different formats.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- Bootstrap 4.5.2
- jQuery 3.6.4



## Features

- *Subnet Analysis:* Enter an IP address and subnet mask to analyze the network information. The analysis includes details such as address range, IP class, network bits, subnet mask in binary, prefix bits, subnet bits, host bits, number of possible subnets, and number of hosts per subnet.

- *IP Converter:* Easily convert IP addresses between formats using the IP Converter tool. Whether you need decimal, binary, this tool simplifies the process.
